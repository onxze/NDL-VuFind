<h2>Finna is much more than a search service</h2>

<p>Through Finna, you can not only search for material, but also gain access to it. Currently, the following <em>libraries</em> provide functions for reserving material, renewing loans and other activities in Finna:</p>
<ul>
{foreach from=$loginTargets item=target}
<li>{translate text=$target prefix='source_'}</li>
{/foreach}
</ul>
<p>After <a href="https://www.finna.fi/MyResearch/Home?lng=en-gb">logging in to Finna</a>, these functions are available to you with a library card for the library in question.</p>
<p>An application for browsing <em>archive</em> material, that requires permission to use, can be made through links found in Finna content data.</p>
<p>In the future, digital <em>museum</em> services will also be available in Finna.</p>
